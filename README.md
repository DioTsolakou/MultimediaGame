Platformer Game for Multimedia course.

TO DO :

-Increase character size, 40x40 is too small.

-Implement the cyclical nature of idle and running animations correctly.

-Add lives and add hurt and death animations when getting hit and dying.

-Implement mouse events for attacking, e.g. left click = quick/normal attack, right click = strong attack.
